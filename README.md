# Jua-Kali-Miner

## About

Jua-Kali-Miner was invisioned as a project to find a way to run hashboards off of direct DC power.
In this Dev release we've got M30s hashboards hashing while using an ePIC UMC control board.

## General Hardware Overview

1. Arduino Nano
2. 2x M30s hashboards
3. Raspberry Pi 5
4. ePIC UMC control board

## Build JuaKali

### Hardware Repo

Contains wiring diagrams, hardware lists, and assembly instructions.

### Code Repo

Contains directions to setup a Raspberry Pi and Arduino Nano for a JuaKali Miner,
As well as the code required for them.
